In this project I create FMCW-based radar systems that detect the range and velocity of the object.
We also want to detect ghost targets in the radar systems. This ghost target appears in a multi-target environment. We create some algorithms to determine this ghost target. I use Matlab to simulate my software both single and multi-target detection. I also make some hardware simulations in an LT-SPICE program.
